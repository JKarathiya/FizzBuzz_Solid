# TDD FizzBuzz Kata

#### What is this FizzBuzz
Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division.[1] Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz". What needs to be done!

The idea behind this exercise is to solve the simple problem of writing the numbers from 1 to N according to the following three rules:
  - Number is divisible by 3 –> write Fizz
  - Number is divisible by 5 –> write Buzz
  - Number is divisible by 3 and 5 –> write FizzBuzz
  - Otherwise write number
